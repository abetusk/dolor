item progression:

* sword
  - bomb
* bow

* raft


level ideas:

Have a level entrence that's open but inaccessible due to a pit that can't be crossed.
Somewhere there will be 'eyes' that are water pipes.  The bow will need to be aimed
at a switch or something similar to turn on the water to the pipes which will fill the
basin so that the raft can be taken to the entrance.

Make sure the teleporter can't jump to it and the fly-foot can't land.
